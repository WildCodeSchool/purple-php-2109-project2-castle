            <p>â€œLord, the castle is about to be attacked..." 
            You look up from your papers, one of the castle guards comes running towards you, out of breath. He says again: 
            "My lord, the enemy is approaching from the east, we are under attack! " . </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>It is time for you to defend your castle</strong>. After having quickly gathered your officers and taken stock of the situation, you notice that the enemy is sending you troops in waves. A quick consultation with your advisors brings you three possible solutions. Which troop are you going to send into battle? 
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>In this game you will have <strong> choose the type of troop to send into battle</strong>, each type having a higher strength ratio than another type. Your warlord informs you: 
            <strong>"Archers are stronger against pikemen. 
            Pikemen are stronger against knights. 
            Knights are stronger against archers."</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Your prime minister intervenes: <strong>"Be careful with the fatigue of your troops, it makes them less effective in combat."</strong></p><br><p>
            Indeed you will have to watch the fatigue rate of your troops, materialized by 5 colored squares that we will call vigor. In each round of combat <strong>the troop used loses 1 point of vigor</strong>, which would result in reducing its power. Moreover, a troop that has used up all its vigor points will no longer be able to fight and will have to rest. <strong>The vigor goes up by 1 point every 2 turns for the unused troops.</strong> 
            In this game you will have to use some strategy, and rely on luck if you want to get out of it.</p><br><p> In each round <strong>the enemy will send you a type of troop in full form</strong>, it's up to you to play wisely by countering this attack with the right type of troop while sparing your men. At the end of each battle a combat result will be calculated and will <strong>increase or decrease the score of your castle</strong> depending on whether you have won or lost.
            While you are deep in thought, you feel a hand gently resting on your forearm. Your warlord announces... 
            "My lord, the enemy is here, you must choose now."
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It's up to you!
